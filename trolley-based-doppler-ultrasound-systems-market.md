<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trolley-based Doppler Ultrasound Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Doppler</li><li>Non Directional Doppler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trolley-based Doppler ultrasound systems come in two primary types: directional and non-directional Doppler. Directional Doppler systems measure blood flow velocity by detecting the frequency shift of ultrasound waves reflected from moving blood cells, allowing for specific directional analysis. Non-directional Doppler, on the other hand, measures the overall blood flow without determining its direction, providing simpler assessments. Both types are essential in clinical settings, offering valuable insights for cardiovascular diagnostics and monitoring.</p></p>
