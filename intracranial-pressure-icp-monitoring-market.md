<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive monitors. Invasive ICP monitors involve the insertion of a device, such as a catheter, directly into the skull to measure pressure accurately in real-time. These are typically used in severe cases requiring close monitoring. Non-invasive ICP monitors use external methods, like transcranial Doppler ultrasound or optical techniques, to estimate intracranial pressure without surgical procedures, appealing for their lower risk and convenience.</p></p>
