<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant market primarily includes two types: Aluminum Hydroxide and Organo-Phosphorus. Aluminum Hydroxide acts as a non-toxic filler, releasing water vapor when heated, which suppresses flames and cools materials. It is widely used in plastics and textiles. Organo-Phosphorus compounds, on the other hand, are more effective at lower concentrations and work by forming a protective char layer when exposed to flames. Both types are crucial for ensuring fire safety in a variety of applications without the use of halogens.</p></p>
